The user could use it to walk around the virtual car to    see it upclose inside and out with detail that would otherwise not    be possible in photos. This would also let them see if the car    could fit in their garage. This product would allow users to hear    the engine noise, view a description and rating of the car, and    visit Autotrader to view listings of the car if the user would    like to purchase the car. The user can also record a video in the    application, which they can save and share to others in social    media. Finally, they can write suggestions regarding improvements    for the application.</p><h4 id="1.1.2">1.1.2 Assumptions and Constraints</h4><p>Assumptions:    <ul>        <li>It is assumed that the user will have a phone compatible with the required toolkits, such as ARKit or ARCore.</li>        <li>The list of mobile devices that are compatible with the toolkits are listed in the requirements document.</li>        <li>It is also assumed that the user has enough space on their devices to download the app and additional space if they wish to save the recorded video.</li>        <li>The user must be able to navigate through the app and interact with the features.</li>        <li>It is also assumed that the user will be connected to the internet for viewing the autotrader website with the cars listed on it.</li>    </ul>Constraints:    <ul>        <li>A few constraints for the schedule are that group members have different times of availability and therefore are not able to make it to meetings regarding important decisions for the project.</li>        <li>There is no project budget, therefore the team cannot use resources that require payments. Therefore effective but free tools/resources must be looked for and used.</li>        <li>Software that will be reused needs to be open source or tutorial code, therefore finding good and free reusable software that will need to be tested rigorously may prove difficult to find.</li>    </ul></p><h4 id="1.1.3">1.1.3 Project Deliverables</h4><p>    The following deliverables will be submitted as files.    The requirements, software project management plan, analysis, and    design are part of the documentation and will be linked to the    website provided as HTML files.    cAR will be an app on newer Android and Apple smartphones. If the    client does not own an appropriate device to install the app    themself, they will be provided a demonstration of the app from the    phone of a project team member.</p><table style="width:50%">    <tr>        <th>Deliverable</th>        <th>Deadline</th>    </tr>    <tr>        <td>Requirements</td>        <td>May 28, 2021</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td>Software Project Management Plan</td>        <td>June 1, 2021</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td>Analysis</td>        <td>June 25, 2021</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td>Design</td>        <td>July 16, 2021</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td>Implementation</td>        <td>August 5, 2021</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td>User documentation</td>        <td>August 5, 2021</td>    </tr></table><h3 id="1.2">1.2 Evolution of the SPMP</h3><p>    As this SPMP is put into action, there will be unscheduled modifications to    the plan as issues arise and are resolved.

Resource requirements and tools are influenced by    the features the application will have. For example, using    Flutter SDK in order to have both iOS and Android versions    of the app. Re-estimation of the schedule is contingent on    the possibility of tasks completion and will be approved by    the entire team. Changing resources or deadlines would be    discussed as a group and done as necessary. The appropriate    updates on documentations would also be done by maintenance    throughout phases of the project. Changes to project costs    due to storage of the car models on the cloud will be    considered as a group. For example, if the amount of writes    or reads exceeds the free plan, changing the plan would be    required to keep the application functional at all times.    If there are conflicts, a poll will be held.</p><h4 id="5.1.2">5.1.2 Staffing Plan</h4><p>    Each team (Documentation, Frontend, App Design, Backend, and    Code Integration) will start off with 4 spots for members to    join/sign up for, however spots may be added or removed    depending on the complexity of the job performed by that team.    Every member of the group must have basic programming    knowledge. All members should be able to solve minor problems    on their own but be able to clearly consult with the rest of    the group on bigger issues. More specifically, during the    project's implementation phase, the implementation team will    require members that have experience in coding and understand    basic data structures. They will need to know how to code in    Flutter and communicate effectively with the rest of the team.    They will also need to know about databases, Swift, Java,    and working with ARCore and ARKit APIs. Throughout the    project the documentation team requires its members to be    capable of collecting information from other teams and    document it (or update the document). Additionally, they    should be willing to read through approximately 20 page    documents to follow the rules and criteria for documenting    the project. Individuals should pick which parts of the    project they would like to work on based on their strengths.</p><h4 id="5.1.3">5.1.3 Resource Acquisition Plan</h4><p>    The acquisition of resources is the responsibility of the    individual team members. This includes a computer that is    connected to the internet, which is used to develop the    application as well as communication with other members.    Smartphones are also needed, including an iPhone and Android    phone to test the cAR application and can also be used for    communication. All members must have their own computer to    work on and those responsible for testing require a    smartphone. These are the only resources that are needed    for the development of cAR in all stages.</p><h4 id="5.1.4">5.1.4 Project Staff Training Plan</h4><p>    Training will be given to members that are part of the    implementation team which will consist of learning how to    use Flutter, basic links will be provided to review data    structures (more for the backend members). There are    approximately 12 members of the implementation team, however    that may change in the future if a member leaves or joins a    team. The links for courses and free tools are provided, the    members must learn flutter during the week of May 30th 2021    and preferably before June 7th 2021. If any questions arise,    the members can reach out to each other and/or the manager    for the implementation team and then a meeting (or more) will    be arranged. Another method of training for all members is to    refer to lecture notes, videos, and attend office hours held by    David Brown. All members were given training on how to use    Trello and be able to communicate with the group effectively    and log their hours. However, managers were also trained    to host meetings for their team.</p><h3 id="5.2">5.2 Work Plan</h3><h4 id="5.2.1">5.2.1 Work Activities</h4><p>The group must complete work activities in order to meet milestones and deadlines.

This task requires basic knowledge of HTML. </li>    </ul></p><p>Resources allocated to Implementation:    <ul>        <li>Prior to the implementation phase, members of the implementation team are provided with links to courses, free videos, and articles on learning Flutter and Dart for frontend programming. </li>        <li>Programmers will also be provided with links to notes and videos regarding data structures as a review of what they should already know for the backend programming.</li>        <ul><li>More detail as the project progresses.</li></ul>        <li>Each member of the team must know the basics of data structures, and should be able to understand any further needed data structures never studied before.</li>    </ul></p><h3 id="5.3">5.3 Control Plan</h3><h4 id="5.3.1">5.3.1 Requirements Control Plan</h4><p>Any significant changes that affect the product requirements have to be approved by at least one member of the group. Each time changes are made, the html file should be updated by website management, Lovette Oyewole. Additionally, through Github, version control is ensured. If the changes affect the project schedule, the team should be notified on Discord. </p><h4 id="5.3.2">5.3.2 Schedule Control Plan</h4><p>The schedule for each team (documentation, frontend/UI, backend, and integration teams) will be managed by the team’s respective manager, which group members were given a chance to sign up for previously. The manager of each team will thencreate a schedule to determine which tasks have to be completed and deadlines for them. The manager will then communicate with the rest of the team members to assign tasks to each member of the team. Using TimeCamp, which is embedded into Trello, team members will track how much time they spend on each task and will be reviewed by the manager at the end of each week. Each team member is responsible for reporting accurate updates of their task status to the team manager at each team meeting. If the team begins to run behind schedule, the manager will collaborate with the rest of the team to brainstorm a solution to create a more reasonable schedule and ensure the schedule is followed in a timely manner. </p><h4 id="5.3.3">5.3.3 Reporting Plan</h4><p>Teams are split into groups which are based on the roles outlined in section 4.3. Each group has a manager that group members will report to. Managers of the group will meet with other managers to give updates of group progress and discuss any changes, if necessary. Meetings for groups are planned according to when members are available. Availability times for each member are written on a timesheet. Group meetings are done regularly using Discord and Zoom and occur weekly, with extra meetings occurring as deadlines approach. Applications including Trello and GitHub are used to track progress and display who authors are. </p><h4 id="5.3.4">5.3.4 Metrics Collection Plan</h4><p>Metrics for the deliverables, listed in clause 1.1.3, shall be received from the client. Metrics are also provided through SQA and versioning. At the end of the semester, each individual is rewarded a project mark that is determined by the level of their contribution. Some of the following are deciding factors:<ul>    <li>Ability to follow through on one’s word</li>    <li>Team member ratings</li>    <li>Team member participation records</li></ul></p><h3 id="5.4">5.4 Risk Management Plan</h3><p>The product should go through wide-ranging testing to prevent user information being exploited. Members from the design team should focus on making sure all aspects of the application are user friendly and easy to use as the user could be inexperienced using a mobile application. All code should be tested by multiple members including the design workflow to gain different perspectives to ensure correctness and prevent potential bugs. Using AR development kits, the application can increase in storage size easily. The application should not take up too much storage space on a mobile device and should be equivalent to other AR related apps. The application should handle the influx of users and their data. Servers must be large enough to have users logged in and using the application concurrently and have protections in place to prevent denial-of-service attacks (DDOS) and Structured Query Language (SQL) injection. Databases must have enough space to store user information, and be encrypted using modern security protocols in order to protect user data, specifically passwords. The database design will be protected from leaks and breaches by staff training, frequent auditing and maintenance</p><h3 id="5.5">5.5 Project Closeout Plan</h3><p>Project cAR will end on August 5th 2021. At the end, the group will collectively:<ul>    <li>Provide soft copies of all documentation/documents to the client.</li>    <li>Archive project materials which include documents, source code, SPMP, requirements documentation, and reference materials.</li>    <li>Members will join a postmortem meeting in which they will observe the project from the initial phase to the end result and debrief where the project succeeded and what needs to be further improved. </li>    <li>The group will also provide a final report which includes information such as the lessons learned and the analysis of project objectives archived. This will be provided to the client at the end.</li></ul></p><h2 id="6">6 Technical Process Plans</h2><h3 id="6.1">6.1 Methods, Tools, and Techniques</h3><p>For documentation, Google Docs will be used as a shared document for the Documentation team to collaborate and then the completed document will be converted into an HTML file to be read online.</p><p>Discord and Zoom will be used for communication among project members.</p><p>The code for the cAR application will be written using Dart (for Flutter 2.2), Java, and Swift. Xcode 12.5 will be used to develop and test the iOS-sided applications, while Android Studio 4.2 will be used to develop and test the Android-sided applications. MySQL Free will be used to manage the application-local database for individual car listings, along with their 3D models. Google Firebase will provide user authentication and user data security.</p><p>The phones used to test the cAR app will be Apple iOS (11.0 or later) and Android OS (7.0 Nougat or later). Use of the app will require a Wi-Fi connection established via the WLAN protocol.</p><h3 id="6.2">6.2 Infrastructure Plan</h3><p>Members working on the cAR project have access to their own workstations which either use MacOS or Windows 10 for development. The team uses Google Drive to store and share documents as well as spreadsheets to keep track of progress. Trello is also used to help organize the team, allowing members to assign tasks which are not yet completed. Other people on the team will see who is working on a given task and will also notice what kind of progress has been made. Members will communicate with each other using Discord along with Zoom for virtual meetings. The user interfaces will be created using Adobe Xd which will be exported to Flutter using the Xd to Flutter plugin where the team will provide functionality to the user interfaces. Everyone on the team will use GitHub to store the project with version control. Members will use a mobile device running either Android or iOS to test the application.</p><h2 id="7">7 Supporting Process Plans</h2><h3 id="7.1">7.1 Configuration Management Plan</h3><p>By using an organization service called Trello, different teams will have different boards in order to help organize what is done, what is being worked on, and what is to be changed. Each team will have their own sections to be used for their tasks and deadlines. After finishing a build, it will be tested and if there needs to be any changes, it will be indicated on the Trello board. As the teams work to fix those errors and add new features, once finalized, they will be released to update the current build of the project and a number system will be put in place in order to keep track of our current and past version builds. The front-end team will be in charge of the way the app looks and it's user-experience design, whereas the back-end team will be focused on making sure the technical aspect (AR functionally, car models, and cloud storage) of the project is functioning. Once both teams agree that their sides are stable, they must work together in order to create an entirely functional app that will be tested. Functions that are not behaving correctly will be noted as well as any bugs, glitches, and overall ease of life changes. Major changes and features will be discussed with everyone and a vote will decide what will be added into the next update. Both teams will work on their respective sides and repeat the process until we end up with a product/build that everyone is satisfied with.</p><h3 id="7.2">7.2 Verification and Validation Plan</h3><p><strong>Documents Verification Protocol</strong></p><p><strong>External tools: </strong>Trello</p><p>While creating the supporting documents, individual contributors follow a software quality assurance (SQA) protocol, as described in section 9. </p><p><strong>Software Development Validation Protocol</strong></p><p><strong>External tools: </strong>Git, GitHub, Trello time tracker</p><p>The product shall be built using a testing driven development through its development cycle.</p><p>Once the software design of the individual sections of the entire product has been agreed upon, each UML class will be assigned a Trello card. The Trello card shall specify a list of test inputs for testing the functions and shall list a corresponding list of valid outputs per test case.</p><p>Members of the individual development team will then acquire a set amount of cards and complete the task of building the specified classes and their corresponding functions. </p><p>Once each class and its functions are built, the individual developer shall perform a unit test of the individual functions and shall provide a screenshot of the unit test’s input and corresponding valid outputs. This screen shot shall then be added to Trello card, it shall then be labelled as “NEEDS REVIEW” and then a pull request to the Git repository shall be sent.</p><p>Two individuals of the development team, other than the authors of the class,  must then perform a code review and verify the authenticity of the inputs and corresponding outputs in the given screenshot. Once the code review comments have been addressed, the manager of the development team can then approve the pull request.</p><p>Throughout this process, a timestamp shall be created in the Trello card, for when the code review process started and when the pull request was accepted.</p><p>This process establishes a record of the product’s verification.</p><h3 id="7.3">7.3 Documentation Plan</h3><p>Non-Deliverable Documents:    <ul>        <li>Software Requirements Document, IEEE Requirements Template,Std 830-1998</li>        <li>Software Design  Document, IEEE Design Document Template, Std 1016</li>        <li>Software Verification Document.</li>        <li>Meetings Attendance</li>        <li>Individual Contributions and time tracking list</li>    </ul></p><p>Deliverable Documents    <ul>        <li>Source Code</li>        <li>User Guide/Document</li>    </ul></p><h3 id="7.4">7.4 Reviews and Audits Plan</h3><p>Both the documentation and code created during the cAR app project are reviewed and audited via the SQA process. When a section of a document or code is considered “complete” by the team member who wrote it, it is flagged for SQA. A different team member then reviews the section and determines if there are any flaws, inconsistencies, or something missing from it. Their suggestions are then written in a separate document and the original author can make changes to their work as needed. Every section of code and documentation must undergo the SQA process before it is complete.</p><h3 id="7.5">7.5 Problem Resolution Plan</h3><p><strong>Show Stoppers</strong></p><p>If a glaring software bug is found in a specific sector of the product that affects the overall integrity of the product, an immediate message shall be sent in the specific development discord channels of the corresponding software sector, with the @everyone tag. If the bug in question involves the other sectors of the product, or a possible fix shall affect the other sectors of the product, then the “@everyone” message shall also be sent to the discord channels of said product sector. </p><p>An immediate meeting must then be scheduled with all the developers of the product sectors involved. </p><p>In such a meeting, a consensus will be reached upon consultation with the developer(s) who were involved in the development of the failed software element. They will identify the next steps needed to resolve the issue, and will put forth any requests for additional resources in the meeting. When a solution has been agreed upon, a Trello card will be created for the bug and shall be labeled as “URGENT SHOW STOPPER”.</p><p>When a show stopper bug is discovered and assigned to a set of developers, all work on other features assigned to said developers will cease immediately, until a fix for the Show Stopper bug has been approved for a pull request, by the manager of all the teams that are affected by the bug.</p><p><strong>Ordinary Bugs</strong></p><p>In the event of an ordinary bug, with side effects contained to a single product sector, a Trello card shall be created immediately in the board for the corresponding product sector. </p><p>The card shall describe the bug and be assigned to a member of the development team, at the discretion of the team's manager. </p><p>In addition, the individual developer identifying the bug will then contact the original author of the product sector using the group Discord communication channel. In case the original author is unable to resolve the issue, the manager will be involved in identifying any additional resources required to resolve the bug.</p><h3 id="7.6">7.6 Process Improvement Plan</h3><p>Task assignment, especially for documentation, has met with some organizational issues resulting in work being completed too close to the deadline. There has been difficulty with assigning tasks too late, members missing information, and a lack of organization around scheduling group meetings. The documentation manager will be responsible for creating a Google Doc with a brief explanation of the process to complete the current documentation. This Google Doc will include links to relevant notes, signup locations for sections and SQA, a place to input when members have time for a meeting, and explanations of miscellaneous processes such as tracking time and how to perform SQA. The documentation manager will then directly send this document to everyone in the documentation category and set a deadline for a response at most 1 day after sending. The documentation manager will then schedule a meeting around the availability of members and send the time directly to the members. During the meeting, the documentation manager must go through the documentation and formally assign at least one member each for writing and SQA for every section. The team members will give an approximate time for when they will finish their work before the documentation manager assigns a milestone date for the entire group. Sections with no assigned volunteers will be assigned as per the level of expertise and total participation of the group members. The documentation manager will record these tasks and deadlines and check in with team members accordingly, while coordinating with programming categories through the programming manager.</p><h2 id="9">9 Plan Annexes</h2><p>The process of SQA for this project is as follows:    <ol>        <li>Author completes work and is confident it is ready to be revised. The respective card for the task, on Trello, is moved to the “SQA Needed” list.  </li>        <li>Author attaches a blue label to the respective card on Trello.            <ol><li>When applicable, the author also highlights the section title on the document red. </li></ol>        </li>        <li>Individual(s) assigned to SQA the task adds comments to the SQA file and changes the status field to yellow. A yellow label is added to the card. </li>        <ol><li>When applicable, the section title is updated to yellow. </li></ol>        <li>SQA person(s) notifies the author.</li>        <li>Author reviews suggested changes and chooses to accept/reject. </li>        <li>The SQA file is updated to catalog actions that took place regarding the decision. </li>        <ol><li>If changes are accepted, the status field is changed to green and the author includes comments, if needed. </li>            <li>If changes are rejected, the status field is changed to red and the author includes justification as comments. </li>            <li>When applicable, the section title is updated to green. </li></ol>        <li>The author updates the card, by attaching a green label. </li>        <li>Once a card has a green label, it should be moved to the “Done” list.</li>    </ol></p><h2>Authors</h2><p>	Kanav, Muhammed, Zhenyang, Jordan, Lovette, Abhirup, Hilal, Joanne, Matthew, Sameer</p></body></html>
